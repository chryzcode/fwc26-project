          In the world of business, understanding the difference between a market opportunity and a problem is crucial for success. A market opportunity is a favorable situation in which a company can introduce a new product or service to meet an unmet need. A problem, on the other hand, is a pain point experienced by customers that may or may not have a viable solution.

          <strong>Identifying true opportunities</strong> requires research, creativity, and a deep understanding of your target audience. Sometimes, what appears to be a problem is actually a symptom of a larger, more lucrative opportunity.
